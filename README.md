# YouTubeTrendingScraper

This script scrapes the YouTube trending page for relevant information and exports it to a CSV file.

# THIS IS AN ALPHA  
This code is a mess and is frankly embarrassing  
However, it works.  

# Dependencies  
This script uses selenium-webdriver to scrape the page. I have not included the web driver so you'll need to get that situated yourself.  I'm not even using the CSV module to export the data. the code just blindly accepts all errors and is in no way pip 8 compliant. so fair warning.  

# Disclaimer  
This script is as is. Use at your own risk read it before you use it and I'm not responsible for how you use the script or the information it scrapes.  

# Potential Uses  
let's say someone wanted to keep track of the YouTube trending page and and create a database that can be graphed and analyzed to draw some conclusions yes.  
  
The script will return the rank, title,  number of views, channel name, Channel link,  video link, metadata, and how long ago the file was uploaded, it's also capable of telling if a video is live.
